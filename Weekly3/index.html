    <h1>IML300:In Defense of the Poor Image</h1>
    <p class="blueText">While reading Hito Steyerl’s In Defense of the Poor Image I enjoyed reading about how versatile a poor image is today. It somewhat reminds me how viral a meme or trend can become. A poor image is media that has been uploaded, downloaded, shared, or altered. While it lowers its quality it improves the images accessibility to anyone for an ease of sharing information and ideas. I believe this can relate to how images and trends get popular nowadays with the internet. Most trends or memes are easy to replicate or add onto so a viewer can become a co-author. A co-author that can spread more awareness to the image or add more ideas to it with their own twist. I love how Steyerl explains this idea with the analogy of how, “cinema takes on the role of a flagship store” and DVDs, broadcast television, or online media are the “more affordable derivatives of the same images.” While they are lower quality and resolutions it circulates the idea of the flagship store faster than its expensive counterpart. The poor image is able to jump over and communicate with every level of society and promote the start to conversations of particular subjects, “it merges art with life and science.” In addition, it does not have any hidden capitalistic intentions to what it shares. Its only reason to exist is to promote communication through a simple image or trend. This is “an art of the people.” It blurs the origin of where it has come from and who is the author and who is the audience. Which may be a problem for some artists if they don’t have the ability to explain why they need credit for their work. This brings us to the only issue of the poor image, piracy. The ease of access in reposting a poor image as your own causes this media production to have false authors and stolen work. However, piracy has always been an issue for any source of media. All in all, the poor image is the true reflection to reality. A reality of art that is not made under capitalist intention, but to promote fun and engaging information.</p>
