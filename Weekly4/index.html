    <h1>IML300:All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace</h1>
    <p class="blueText">The new idea developed from cybernetics was that we are all intertwined with each other and the environment on “spaceship Earth.” This caused a great cultural impact in the society of the mid 70s. Many people at the time believed that self organizing networks can replace regional government, so they developed communes without any social power in it. They wished we could have an environment that can balance itself rather than be under an authoritarian rule. Cybernetics also affected how we saw ourselves biologically. The human brain was believed to be like a system powered by electricity. Sigmund Freud also believed everything in nature was wired together through networks. He called these ecosystems that will always try to stabilize themselves if they were affected by an outside source. These ecosystems were adaptable to future behavior and were balanced through feedback. If there was a problem the solution would become the effect that will balance the environment into a new version of the ecosystem. His work made nature seem quite mechanical when we actually were familiar with how ecosystems worked. Cybernetics ultimately believed that a mathematical formula was shared between humans and machines that explained we were exactly the same and just belonged in a universal system. It claimed that everyone was just nodes and networks. This prompted ecologists to take inspiration from cybernetics by claiming that the Earth was ultimately one large machine all wired together. This caused biological reality to disappear as they thought of every part of Earth’s fundamentals was a fusion of systems that could work nonstop if it was left alone. In addition, experimental Geodesic domes were seen to be just smaller forms of ecosystems because they were weak until formed together to make a balanced structure. This addressed the worry for a whole system rather than the individual participating in it. Cybernetics could be summed up by claiming that Earth could only function correctly if the structure of power destroyed class structures and presented a better idea of being just a member to a balanced system.</p>
