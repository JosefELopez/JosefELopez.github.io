    <h1>IML300:#ACCELERATE MANIFESTO</h1>
    <p class="blueText">Based on the reading we can see that Accelerationism is highly anti-capitalism and progressive in its gender roles in the workforce. The ideas of acceleration is similar to capitalism, however it also has some neoliberalism ideals in its manifesto. While capitalism usually “demands for economic growth” and is a non stop competition between the entities that live inside of it, it still has some ideals Accelerationism wouldn’t follow. Capitalism is able to function because of technological growth in our current society. Technological growth in our current society is based on this competitive marketing of products to consumers. After an entity is profitable from this scheme it has a competitive advantage to continue this cycle. However, this manifesto shows that Accelerationism has somewhat neoliberalism thinkings because it promotes the use of a free market in hopes to be “liberating the forces of creative destruction, setting free ever-accelerating technological and social innovations.” Their intentions are to have an organization that promotes productive forces of technology towards societal growth rather than monopolistation.
	Furthermore, Accelerationism also fears stepping back into Fordism. Fordism is terms to explain the capitalist “golden era” where couples were split apart from the rapid motion of mass production at the Ford Motor Company during its postwar setting of economic growth. It splits apart couples and society into tight fitting gender roles. The environment of the postwar factory was a place for only male workers. These workers were drained from a productive career and were placed in this repetitive boring function of a factory. The environment of suburban life was a place for only females. These housewives were subjugated to not making their own paycheck, which caused them to rely on their husbands for their family to progress in the capitalist hierarchy. Fordism brought sexism and racism as it brought along new goods for the postwar America. However, with Accelerationism it promotes a future that is more progressive and modern in its approaches to societal growth.</p>
