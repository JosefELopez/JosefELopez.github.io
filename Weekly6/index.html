    <h1>IML300: Accelerationism 2 - XENOFEMINISM: A Politics for Alienation</h1>
    <p class="blueText">Based on the reading we can see the growth of Accelerationism to become Xenofeminism, or XF for short. XF is a new age technological understanding of feminism in this digital age. It is considered to be part “anti-naturalist” and part “gender-abolitionist.” The purpose of XF is not to destroy the male centered world of the tech industry, but to embed itself into it. We live in a society that, “swarms with technological mediation, interlacing our daily lives with abstraction, virtuality, and complexity.” This movement explains how XF is a new form of feminism that prompts a more realistic future of justice for all genders to contribute equally to innovation and politics. In addition, it also disregards the boundaries of race, class, accessibility, and region someone associates with.
	Most importantly, XF is anti-naturalist, meaning it goes against natural order. It supports people of the “unnatural order” by deciding all others should be integrated, such as the queer and trans community, the disabled, and women out of work from maternal leave. This is one of the ways XF plans to reuse existing technologies to re-engineer and re-imagine our society. We must rethink the role of gender in the near future to link all genders by using preexisting technology. With the technology we already have, we should combat to counter unequal wage and payment issues, worsening economic instability, and unequal access to reproductive and pharmacological tools.
	Furthermore, XF role in the new age is to forward feminist ideology of gender-abolition. While this sounds to be “destroy all genders and all labels,” it is actually code for the ability to create a society where the traits one inherits limits them from an inability to reach a form of “asymmetric operation of power.” Gender abolitionism can also go hand and hand with Race abolitionism to disregard any form of natural discrimination of anyone’s color.
Ultimately, Xenofeminism can change the “nature” of any justification in the workforce or political platform! It brings in a new role to consider every individual without bias.</p>
